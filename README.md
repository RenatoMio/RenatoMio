## My Research Focus  
I am a doctoral researcher at the **Chair of Digital Health with a Focus in Data Science (University of Bayreuth, Germany)** and a member of the **Brain and Behaviour Laboratory (Imperial College London, UK)**. My current research centers on **non-invasive neural interfaces for human augmentation**.

### Previous Projects  
- Studying the learning process for controlling an **additional robotic finger** to play the piano.  
- Designing a **myoelectric hand prosthesis**.  
- Developing control systems for a **lower-limb exoskeleton**.
