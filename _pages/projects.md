## PhD Project (July 2022 – Present)
**Motor learning-based control of peripheral nerves for supernumerary degrees of freedom (sDoFs)**  
*Description:* The project focuses on using neural signals acquired non-invasively as an interface modality to control human augmentation devices. Decomposition of high-density surface electromyography yields individual motoneuron signals that augment the human output space with more degrees of control, ideal for controlling augmentation devices and the body's own parts simultaneously.  
*Keywords:* Human-Machine Interfacing, Neuroscience, HD EMG, Motor Unit Decomposition, Reinforcement Learning, Matlab, Python, Data Analysis

## Project (August 2022 – Present)
**Supernumerary Robotic Fingers for Assistance in Cylindrical and Pinch Grasps**  
*Description:* This project presents an assistive device comprising two supernumerary robotic fingers aimed at individuals with hand grasping limitations. The extra fingers assist in performing power grasps, such as cylindrical grips, in conjunction with the user’s palm, or precision grasps, like pinch grips. Actuated by servomotors, their positions are controlled by commands derived from the wearer’s wrist movements, providing a natural control interface that avoids using joints unrelated to the motor task.  
*Keywords:* Assistive Robotics, Supernumerary Robotic Fingers, Grasping, Robotics, Matlab, C#, Arduino

## Co-investigator (January 2021 – July 2022)
**Development of a Transhumeral Arm Prosthesis with Haptic Feedback Controlled by Physiological Signals**  
*Description:* This project aims to design and implement a transhumeral arm prosthesis controlled by a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (using EEG, EMG, and kinematic recordings) and includes non-invasive haptic feedback for enhanced controllability.  
*Keywords:* Arm Prosthesis, Underactuated Mechanisms, Electromyography, Electroencephalography, Haptic Feedback, 3D Printing, Matlab, Autodesk Inventor

## MSc Project (January 2019 – September 2019)
**Prediction of Human Ability for Supernumerary Control based on Individual Motor Skills**  
*Description:* This project explores how human motor skills influence the ability to learn the use of an additional robotic finger to play the piano. Neuroscience principles, data analysis, and linear regression models are applied to find significant correlations between the measured skills.  
*Keywords:* Supernumerary Limbs, Neuroscience, Robotics, Matlab, Microsoft Visual Studio, C#, Arduino, Data Analysis

## Co-investigator (February 2018 – April 2019)
**Optimization of Polymer Utilization on Additive Manufacturing Processes through Computational Modelling and Mechanical Characterization. Case Study: Hand Prostheses.**  
*Description:* The project aims to characterize materials used in 3D printing and predict the properties of parts manufactured with this method to improve their performance and that of the assembled product—a 3D-printed hand prosthesis.  
*Keywords:* Material Testing, Benchmark Testing, 3D Printing, Ultimaker, Body-powered Prosthesis, Hand Prosthesis

## Co-founder (January 2017 – Present)
**[Giving a Hand](https://dandounamanoperu.org)**  
*Description:* This social start-up aims to provide customized hand prostheses to low-income individuals in Peru using digital manufacturing technology.  
*Keywords:* 3D Printing, Ultimaker, Body-powered Prosthesis, Hand Prosthesis

## Co-investigator (February 2016 – December 2017)
**Implementation of a Myoelectric Upper-Limb Transradial Prosthesis with Force Control and Haptic Feedback**  
*Description:* This project aims to implement a hand prosthesis capable of moving each finger independently, controlling grasp force, and sending force feedback signals to the user.  
*Keywords:* Autodesk Inventor, MATLAB, Robotics, 3D Printing, Electromyography, Ultimaker, Hand Biomechanics, Hand Prosthesis

## Research Assistant (March 2015 – December 2016)
**Development of a Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Gait Patterns Reproduction and Movement Assistance**  
*Description:* This project aims to develop a robotic exoskeleton that can be attached to the user’s lower limbs to provide rehabilitation therapy by coordinating motor motions, thus simulating gait movement.  
*Keywords:* Simulink Real-time, MATLAB, Microsoft Visual Studio, C#, Torque Control, Gait Analysis, CAN Communication
