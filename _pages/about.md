I am **Renato Mio**, a doctoral researcher and research assistant at the **Chair of Digital Health with a Focus on Data Science**, University of Bayreuth, Germany. With a background in **Biomedical Engineering** (MSc) and **Mechatronics Engineering** (BSc), my research focuses on **neural interfaces for human augmentation**, particularly on decoding muscle-related neural signals to generate commands for external devices.

Currently, I work on setting up the **Kulmbach Living Lab**, a fully sensorized apartment for human behavior studies, and collaborate with the **Brain and Behaviour Laboratory** at Imperial College London as part of the **Borderless Lab initiative**. My work spans:

- Developing advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques for non-invasive neural interfacing.
- Teaching courses on **Python for Digital Health**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and leading seminars in **Brain-Computer Interfaces**.
- Mentoring students and assisting with high-impact research projects.

I co-founded **LAT Bionics**, a Peruvian social start-up dedicated to designing low-cost, customized bionic prostheses, and have led or contributed to several funded projects on rehabilitation robotics, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. My research has been featured in **Scientific Reports**, **Imperial College News**, and major international media outlets like **Reuters** and **New Scientist**.
