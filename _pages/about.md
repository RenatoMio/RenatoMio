Welcome to my personal website! I am **Renato Mio**, a research assistant at the **Chair of Digital Health** at the **University of Bayreuth**, where I specialize in **neurotechnology** and **wearable robotics**. My work spans multiple domains, including:

- **Research**: Exploring innovative solutions in neurophysiology, neurobehavioral studies, and advanced wearable systems.
- **Teaching**: Educating both undergraduate and master’s students, fostering their curiosity and guiding them in life sciences and neurotechnology.
- **Administrative Duties**: Managing the procurement of high-end medical research equipment and contributing to institutional projects.

### My Interests
I am particularly passionate about:
- Real-time signal processing, with a focus on force calibration and EMG data collection.
- High-density EMG and high-end EEG and fNIRS technologies for neurophysiological research.
- Promoting interdisciplinary collaborations between artificial intelligence and life sciences.

### Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out to me if you’re interested in collaborating on projects or if you’re a student eager to learn about neurotechnology and wearable robotics. Together, we can advance the frontiers of digital health!
