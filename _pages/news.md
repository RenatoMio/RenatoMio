**02/2025** Ended the semester by presenting a **poster** at the **[AI Day](https://www.rais2.uni-bayreuth.de)** at Uni Bayreuth, representing the [AI Association](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html). It was a great opportunity to connect with others using **AI/ML** in their research!

**02/2025** New **paper** accepted! Our paper on the [body-powered supernumerary robotic finger](https://github.com/RenatoMio/bpSRF) was accepted at [ICORR 2025](https://icorr-c.org), part of [RehabWeek](https://rehabweek.org) taking place this May in Chicago.

**12/2024** New **[repository](https://github.com/RenatoMio/bpSRF)** published! Released the **bpSRF**, a body-powered supernumerary robotic finger for hand augmentation that requires no electronic components. The [repository](https://github.com/RenatoMio/bpSRF) includes files for 3D printing and full assembly instructions.

**11/2024** Two **papers** published on the [experimental characterization of a soft robotic device for mechanotherapy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10782663) and the [computational analysis of its interaction with skin-muscle tissue](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10782886).

**11/2024** Our [Bayreuth AI Association](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html) is now live on LinkedIn! Follow us [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bayreuth-ai-association/).

**10/2024** Our **[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10719816)** on the upper-limb prosthetic tool for handlebar-driven vehicles is now live on IEEE Xplore.

**09/2024** Presented a **[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gZYVSDfa1JtAwqObbTi2WXZDAx2tNI-v/view?usp=drive_link)** on a low-cost upper-limb prosthetic tool for handlebar-driven vehicles at [BioRob 2024](https://www.biorob2024.org) in Heidelberg, Germany.

**07/2024** Completed the **[certification](https://portal.neuromatchacademy.org/certificate/1bc42cc1-9dea-4526-a6ee-c671a9172016)** for the [NeuroAI course](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io) by Neuromatch Academy. Ready to apply what I learned on neuro-inspired AI and ML!

**07/2024** Presented a **[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yv2fcYvdUpcuaJlFeGLkEX01z2izDLAD/view?usp=sharing)** at the [HybridNeuro 2024](https://www.hybridneuro.feri.um.si/summerschools/summer_school_mb.html) meeting in Maribor, Slovenia. It was a great opportunity to delve into techniques for improving the motor unit decomposition pipeline and network with talented academics in the field.

**05/2024** **Featured** by [UBTaktuell](https://ubtaktuell.uni-bayreuth.de/en/bayreuth-ai-association) for co-founding the new [Bayreuth AI Association](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html), aiming to create a space for the open exchange of ideas and experiences in the hands-on use of AI/ML algorithms.

**04/2024** Presented a **[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kBlPfE_kr3WV9e0rjOBWC9FSO4G9oKw/view?usp=sharing)** at the [Neural Control of Movement (NCM)](https://ncm-society.org) meeting in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Highlights included talks and posters by Meta on non-invasive neural interfacing.

**12/2023** Presented a **[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DpTwF4H6sdqBJrMI3x_ZBgHl-5VQmVk/view?usp=sharing)** at the [Neurophysiological Bases of Human Movement](https://www.physoc.org/events/neurophysiological-bases-of-human-movement/) meeting at King’s College London, UK. Discussions with other researchers applying motor unit decomposition inspired new approaches for upcoming projects.

**12/24** Our lab was featured by **[Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/news/2023-12/03/wohnungen-als-ki-labor-forschung-zu-menschlichem-verhalten)**, **[SAT1](https://www.sat1.de/serien/1730-sat1-bayern/videos/ki-projekt-in-kulmbach-erstes-live-in-lab-gestartet-v_1ajkphrp575f)**, **[Süddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/wissenschaft-kulmbach-uni-erforscht-menschliches-verhalten-wohnungen-als-ki-labor-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-231203-99-168170)**, and **[idw](https://nachrichten.idw-online.de/2023/12/04/university-of-bayreuth-opens-kulmbach-live-in-lab-for-holistic-research-on-digital-health)** regarding our “live-in-lab,” an apartment equipped with sensors for real-world human behavior studies. More information in this [press release](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/press-releases/AI-wearables-neurological-diseases).

**11/2023** Attended the **Augmentation Day** workshop at Imperial College London, featuring expert talks and live demos of the **[MUVE system](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-robotics/dr-octopus-/)**. Controlling extra arms was a surreal experience.
