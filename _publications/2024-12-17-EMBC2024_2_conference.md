Studying the soft robot-tissue mechanical interaction in muscle stimulation devices poses a significant challenge due to the complex behavior of the materials involved. To advance this field, this paper models computationally three types of soft elastomeric actuators designed to perform deep cyclic compression stimuli on human soft tissues for muscle rehabilitation by mechanotherapy. The analysis focuses on the interaction between a phantom representing transversely isotropic muscle and homogeneous skin, with a soft robotic device comprised of a hyperelastic actuator and a rigid support. Results from deformation, stress-strain and surface pressure analysis demonstrate efficient actuation, suggesting deep and focused stimulation on the muscle, while actuators exhibit reliable safety factors and load distribution, implying longer operational life. This lightweight and compact soft robotic device is suitable for integration into a wearable suit for targeted muscle groups stimulation in the lower limbs. Furthermore, this computational approach represents a significant advance in the biomechanical study of soft robot-human tissues interaction, with potential for generalization in similar biomedical device applications. Keywords—Soft Robotics, Mechanotherapy, Transversely Isotropic Muscle, Human-Robot interaction.
