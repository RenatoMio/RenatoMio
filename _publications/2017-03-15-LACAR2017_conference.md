A great number of new proposals for prosthetic hands made by 3D printing have been developed. These prostheses are either body powered for partial hand amputees, or myoelectric powered prostheses for transradial amputees. However, there are no current studies to develop powered 3D printed prostheses for transmetacarpal or partial hand amputees, probably because at this level of amputation there is little space to fit actuators and their associated electronics; nevertheless, it is not an impossible task. For that reason, in this work, it is proposed a design of a hand prosthesis aimed for transmetacarpal amputees and powered by DC micromotors. Additionally, a method for customizing prosthetic fingers to match a user specific anthropometry is shown. Finally, sensors and actuators selection is explained, and a basic control scheme is tested on the prototype.
