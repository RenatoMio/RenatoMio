The first exoskeleton development in Peru was performed at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP), supported by health professionals, with the aim of treating locomotion disability which is the second main limitation affecting Peruvians these days. It is a lower limb exoskeleton for assisting normal gait and stair climbing in the sagittal plane whose dynamic model was obtained from data collected from over 40 Peruvian young adults. The proposed mechanical design is a hip-knee-ankle device that is electrically actuated and which also allows for passive rotation of hip and ankle in the frontal plane. Additionally, the system includes a trolley and a telescopic guide which allow for horizontal and vertical movement of patient’s center of mass; therefore, these parameters can also be controlled in order to obtain customized therapies. Currently, a simplified model of this design is being implemented in order to verify exoskeleton proper behavior and its response to control system commands.
